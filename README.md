## Description of challenge

I was tasked with creating a weather app using the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather for any given city.  In addition to meeting the acceptance criteria and following the mock-up, it must also use local storage to store persistent data.  User can then quickly reference past searches.

##  Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
* WHEN I search for a city
* THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index
* THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
* THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history
* THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
